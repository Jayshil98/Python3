- Like a list, we can get a slice from a string!
    - This is called a substring
    - Use the same colon(:) syntax


- Format: [start_index:end_index]
    - start_index is the index of the first value (included in slice)
    - end_index is the index of the last value (not included in slice)


```python
s = 'Hello world!'
```


```python
#get substring using slice
print(s[:5]) #charaters 1 to 5
```

    Hello
