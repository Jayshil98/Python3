Function:
- Block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action
- Provides better modularity for your applications and a high degree of code reusing.
- Python provides Built-in functions as a Part of the core language
- Define your own user-defined functions

Built-in Functions:
1) To print a String
- print("Hello World!") 

2) For User Input
- input("What is your name?")

3) int function to cast one datatype to integer
- int(3.1)

4) float function cast given string or integer to float
- float(x)

5) round function rounds the given float to int in given decimal place
- round(float, int)

6) Gives the maximum value of the given arguments 
- max(arg1, arg2, argN)

7) Gives the minimum value of the given arguments
- min(arg1, arg2, argN)

8) Gives the length or the number of items of the given object
- len(s)

User-defined Functions:
1) Functions have conventions
- Name a function based on what it does
- Whitespace is important!
    - Function Body "code blocks" (group of statements) have to be indented (4spaces or tab) 

2) Sometimes a function takes an input 
- They are called parameters
- When you call (or use) the function, you pass arguments to satisfy the parameters

3) Sometimes a function produces an output
- This is called the function's retrun value

4) You define a funtion using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parenthesis
- def function_name(param_1, ..., paramN):

    statements
    
    return


```python

```
